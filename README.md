# [Build a Static Site Generator With SPL Iterators][published url]
## Instructor: [Matthew Setter][instructor url]


In PHP, we're all familiar with the `foreach`, `for`, `do`-`while`, and `while` looping constructsâ€”constructs which help us quickly, and easily, iterate over data structures in our applications.

But did you know that they're just the tip of the iceberg, and that you can use these constructs in a much more powerful way?

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Matthew Setter will introduce you to SPL iterators, and teach you how to create iterator classes which allow you to use the looping constructs to iterate over your data in a more powerful, more flexible, and more elegant way than you've done before. Along the way, you'll build a simple static site generator which reads markdown from a filesystem directory listing and creates hydrated value objects which model the data they contain.


## Source Files Description

This repository contains the completed source code for the course project - a simple static site generator. The course project is created largely with a small collection of PHP's SPL iterators, along with a few other packages to make the process as simple as possible.

The project is an application which, primarily, uses, some SPL iterators to provide the following functionality:

- Retrieve a filesystem directory listing
- Filter out any non-markdown file
- Create a list of hydrated value objects which model the data in the Markdown files
- Provide a range of functionality for filtering, sub-filtering, and rendering the information collated

Through this hands-on, practical project, the student will see how effective iterators can be in creating simple, maintainable, and reusable code.
